# Alcohol Tracker Program

This is a simple Python-based terminal application that allows you to track your alcohol consumption. It logs the drinks you've consumed, their volume, cost in SEK (Swedish Kronor), and provides statistics like daily, weekly, and monthly totals. The program also allows you to remove drinks, add drinks for different days, and view costs for the current month.

## Features

- View daily, weekly, and monthly statistics (total volume and cost).
